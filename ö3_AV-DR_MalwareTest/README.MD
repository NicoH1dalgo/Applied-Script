\# AV/EDR Detection Test Script



\## Description

This Python script is designed to test antivirus (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities on Windows systems. The script performs the following actions:



1\. \*\*OS Verification\*\*: Checks if the system is running Windows OS

2\. \*\*EICAR Test File Creation\*\*: Creates a text file containing the EICAR test string

3\. \*\*AV/EDR Response Monitoring\*\*: Observes whether the antivirus or EDR solution detects and quarantines the file



\## What is EICAR?

The EICAR (European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research) test file is a standard, safe method to test antivirus software without using actual malware. It's a harmless text string that all antivirus programs recognize as a test virus.



\## Purpose

\- Test if antivirus software is active and functioning properly

\- Verify EDR detection capabilities

\- Educational demonstration of security software behavior

\- Safe alternative to testing with real malware



\## Usage

```bash

python av-test.py

```



\## Expected Behavior

If your antivirus/EDR is working correctly:

\- The file should be detected immediately upon creation

\- The file should be quarantined or deleted

\- You should receive an alert/notification from your security software



\## Safety Note

This script uses only the standard EICAR test string, which is completely harmless and designed specifically for testing purposes. It contains no actual malicious code.



\## Requirements

\- Windows OS

\- Python 3.x

\- Active antivirus/EDR solution (for testing)
